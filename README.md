# Notion

This Maven App allows you sync specific Notion pages to your Maven knowledge base for training.

## Getting Started

To install the app you will need to do the following:
- You'll need to create an integration and obtain an API key (also known as an integration token)

Every time code is deployed either via the App Studio or by commiting to this repo, the Maven App will be updated and available at your app url:

`https://<appId>.onmaven.app`

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`.

To edit Maven App hooks modify `src/index.ts`.
