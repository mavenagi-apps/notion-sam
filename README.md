# Notion

This Maven App allows you sync specific Notion pages to your Maven knowledge base for training.

## Getting Started

Every time code is deployed either via the App Studio or by commiting to this repo, the Maven App will be updated and available at your app url:

`https://<appId>.onmaven.app`

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`.

To edit Maven App hooks modify `src/index.ts`.
